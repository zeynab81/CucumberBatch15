    API - Application Programming Interface NOTES

non Technical example - ms cafe - Cafe( client server intermediator)
Technical example - ATM - Bank Example
technical example

Client - the one who sends the request (user)
server - the one who gives the response to the request
API - an intermediator who transfers the information from client to server and from server to client

presentation layer - (UI-user interface (FrontEnd)/UX- ) - what we see on the screen is presentation layer
Application layer - it is the place where the logic of the application has been written
API - middle layer/ middleware (API developers / API testers)
data Layer - (backend) - where data is coming from.

Client - server architecture

1 tier architecture - when the presentation layer, application layer and data layer
        are available at the same place, is called 1 tier architecture
        examples: calculator, notepad, wordpad, games, paint etc.

2 tier architecture - when presentation layer is available on clients end and
        application/data layer is available on server end
        examples: dominos, mc.donalds, pizza hut, kfc etc.

3 tier architecture - when your presentation layer is available at client end
        Application/Business layer is available at another end and data layer
        is available at server end
        example - hrms application

n tier architecture - when we have n number of presentation layers, n number of
        application layers, n number of data layers
        examples: amazon, instagram, fb etc.

Why do we need API's?

front end - react, native
back end - java, python, js

1. to make the systems communicate which are developed in different languages, we use API's.
2. for security purpose.

Why do we need to test API?
to make sure that the same information is coming from the db is reflecting on the front end

CRUD operations:
1. create a new record in the database
2. retrieve the the record from the database
3. update a record in the database
4. delete a record from the database

CRUD operations - to test the API we need address of the API and we need the endpoint

DNS domain name server
IP address - 2.323.432.212
address of the API -
    url - uniform resource locator
    location of the api - group of similar api's

end point - specific details

BASE URI - uniform resource identifier
BASE URI - Base url + endpoint

Base URL - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api
endpoint - /getAllEmployees.php

BASE URI - hrm.syntaxtechs.net/syntaxapi/api/getAllEmployees.php
