    /*The ways we can use data in our codes.

1.Hard code
2.property file
3.regular expression in " " double code like "admin" and "password"
4.scenario outline

    1. Parameterization allows you to pass values into your tests at runtime, rather than hardcoding them into the code itself.
    This makes your tests more flexible and less brittle, as you can modify the values without having to modify the code.

    2. Data Driven is when we use any excel sheet to fitch data or from any other external source into our code.

     #HOOKS: For defining Pre and Post steps in any Cucumber framework
    #     : This is always created inside the StepDefinitions folder
    #     : Hooks will take care of Pre and post conditions irrespective
    #     : of what goes in between the test steps
    #
    # BACKGROUND: It's the clubbing of common steps in different scenarios of a feature file
    #             till flow is not broken
    #1. Hard Code
    #2. Config file
    #-----------------Cucumber itself provides multiple option through which we can feed data from
    # feature file into Step Definition---------------------------------------------
    #3. Regular Expressions
    # Put the data in double quotes [""]
    #====================================PARAMETERIZATION========================================
    # Executing the same test case with multiple data.
    # TestNG we use Parameterization in DataProvider

    #If you want to use parameterization
    # If you wish to implement data driven testing
    # Scenario Outline is always used along with the keyword 'Examples
